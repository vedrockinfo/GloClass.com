                                                    freedom. Today franchising is an excellent opportunity

                                                <p>In a sense, franchising is a business model with primary risk
                                                    minimisation. Every study ever done on the success rate of
                                                    new (non-franchisee) business startups concludes that starting up a
                                                    new business is very risky. Most studies show that
                                                    over 90% fail within one year. The primary reason the failure rate
                                                    is so high is that the owners have to go through the
                                                    learning curve of operating the business. Unfortunately, the
                                                    marketplace is not very tolerant of the inexperienced new
                                                    type trying to learn how to manage a new business. If you can’t
                                                    compete in the marketplace, you can go bust, and you
                                                    lose money, your credit, your home, your reputation and sometimes
                                                    even your family. Failing in business can be a
                                                    horrible experience. Unfortunately, this happens to thousands of
                                                    poor souls every year in the world. Itt is so necessary
                                                    that unless you have considerable experience in the specific
                                                    business you intend to get into, it is very probable that
                                                    you will fail.</p>

                                                <p>There are many reasons to start school. The most common cause is the
                                                    potential to make more money. With your school, you
                                                    can set your tuition, choose your curriculum, and hire your staff.
                                                    You also have the freedom to select your school name,
                                                    colours, and mascot.</p>

                                                <p>However, there are also several disadvantages to starting your
                                                    school. The most significant time and money it takes to
                                                    get a new school up and running.</p>

                                                <p>There are also many reasons to take a school franchise. The most
                                                    common cause is the support you will receive from the
                                                    franchisor. Franchisors typically provide their franchisees with a
                                                    turnkey operation, which includes a curriculum,
                                                    marketing materials, and training. Additionally, many franchisors
                                                    have a national or regional reputation, which can help
                                                    attract students and families to your school.</p>

                                                <p>However, there are also several disadvantages to taking a school
                                                    franchisee. The most significant burden is the cost.
                                                    Franchisors typically charge an upfront franchise fee, as well as
                                                    ongoing royalties. Additionally, you may be required
                                                    to purchase supplies and materials from the franchisor.</p>

                                                <p>Considering taking a school franchise, you should weigh the pros and
                                                    cons carefully to decide if it is the right
                                                    decision for you.</p>

                                                    trying unsuccessfully to run with “hit and trial” many school
                                                    entrepreneurs, many school entrepreneurs convert their
                                                    school into our franchise. There are many benefits to this,
                                                    including the increased demand from parents for quality
                                                    education and the ability to attract better quality teachers. Plus,
                                                    having a brand name is always a plus! We will try to
                                                    reuse whatever infrastructure you have and then discuss it with you
                                                    based on your finances and investment plan. In most
                                                    cases, the infrastructure is not up to par and does not create a
                                                    “wow” factor among students and teachers. You may need
                                                    to change the infrastructure, and together we will agree upon a plan
                                                    going forward on how to ease the transition from
                                                    your local school to our franchise.

                                                <p>Franchising has become popular for those looking to open their
                                                    project. And, with good reason. Buying a franchise can be
                                                    less risky than starting a project from scratch. When you buy a
                                                    franchise, you’re buying into an established brand. You
                                                    benefit from the marketing that the franchisor has already done.
                                                    And, you have access to tried-and-true systems and
                                                    processes. But, what many people don’t realise is that franchises
                                                    can also be a more efficient way to use your working
                                                    capital.</p>

                                                <p>When you buy a franchise, you’re buying into an established brand.
                                                    You don’t have to spend as much on marketing and
                                                    advertising to get your school off the ground. The franchisor has
                                                    already done the legwork to build brand awareness and
                                                    attract parents. You can piggyback on that investment and get your
                                                    school up and running more quickly and with less

                                                <p>Another way that forces can help you save on working capital is by
                                                    providing ongoing training to franchisees and their
                                                    staff. When you have access to ongoing training, you can ensure that
                                                    your employees are always up-to-date on the latest
                                                    products, services, and procedures. This can help you avoid mistakes
                                                    and improve efficiency, saving you money in the

                                                    decision. Once you’ve announced the launch of your
                                                    school to the public, you can’t change the fee structure frequently.
                                                    And if you make changes, it can show a lack of
                                                    confidence in your actions. However, we understand that it can be
                                                    challenging to decide on your own, which is why we

                                                    your franchise.</p>

                                                <p>First, we look at what other branches of ours in similar locations
                                                    are charging. This gives us an idea of what parents
                                                    in that area are used to paying. We take into account the experience
                                                    of similar franchises and surveys conducted in your
                                                    area to help recommend a fee that will work best for you.</p>

                                                <p>Second, we look at what the local competition is charging. This helps
                                                    us see the going rate for schools in that area.
                                                    You don’t want to be the most expensive school. However, you also
                                                    don’t want to be the cheapest – we want to offer
                                                    parents the best “Value for Money” within the budget of the majority
                                                    of parents.</p>

                                                <p>Based on these two factors, our marketing department will help you to
                                                    decide the correct fee for your school.
                                                    Ultimately, though, the decision is up to you,, and we want to
                                                    ensure that you are comfortable with the fee you set.
                                                    That is why we believe that you have the final say.</p>

                                                <p>It’s a common question asked by those new to franchising or
                                                    considering investing in a franchise – why is royalty
                                                    charged on revenue and not net profit?</p>

                                                <p>There are a few critical reasons for this. Firstly, profits can be
                                                    manipulated since expenses can be inflated. This
                                                    means that it would be difficult to accurately calculate what a
                                                    franchisor’s actual net profit was.</p>

                                                <p>Secondly, checking bills and invoices to ensure there are no fake or
                                                    inflated expenses would lead to much distrust
                                                    between franchisor and franchisee. This would ultimately damage the
                                                    relationship between them.</p>

                                                <p>And thirdly, taking royalty on revenue is simply a more
                                                    straightforward way of calculating it. What should matter to
                                                    franchisees is the amount they are paying and whether they feel they
                                                    are getting value for money. If they are happy with
                                                    the franchise, they will stay. If not, they will leave.</p>

                                                <p>So there you have it. Royalty is charged on revenue because it’s a
                                                    more accurate and straightforward way of calculating
                                                    it.</p>
